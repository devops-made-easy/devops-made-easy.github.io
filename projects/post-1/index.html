        <div class="content"><p>When it comes to cybersecurity, most people have a perception that it is the sole
responsibility of the IT department. However, with the changing times, internet security's
responsibility does not lie on the shoulders of the technical elites alone but is shared by
everyone.
As the cyber-attacks are occurring at multiple levels, it is not only the tech geeks but all
others too who must take the responsibility of safeguarding the IT systems. Still not
convinced? Here are some more reasons to justify that cybersecurity is everyone’s
responsibility. Let’s dive in.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every Individual is a Potential Target
A majority of data breaches due to human error and lack of security awareness. Human
beings are the weakest links and, therefore, easily become a potential target. The cyberattack
techniques such as phishing, social engineering, and others are mainly directed towards
specific individuals.
Through social engineering, the intruder pretends to be someone you are familiar with and
make you fall into the trap easily. This can result in the exploitation of a large amount of
confidential data by the attacker. To prevent such cybersecurity attacks, you need to more
aware and tighten your defense systems. Make sure to think, analyze, and act before
providing important data to someone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing Interconnectedness
Nowadays, there is too much interconnectedness between the workplace IT systems and the
employees' devices. Through the use of multiple apps, employees can sign in and stay
connected with different IT devices. With every new app being added to the system, it opens
the door for potential cybersecurity attacks.
Even though interconnectedness offers a lot of convenience in accessing all the information
and carrying out the business operations faster, it can be risky. It also gives the attacker the
key to access the confidential data of your business. For this reason, make sure to limit the
connectedness and integrations as much as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology is not the Ultimate Solution
Most organizations believe that having Next-Gen security technologies such as SIEM
systems and Firewalls is the key to ensure optimum protection against cyber attacks.
Although it is true to some extent, it is not applicable all the time. Technology proves to be
useful for the initial blocking of the cyberattacks. However, technology fails to prevent
attacks such as vishing. In such a situation, it is the individuals who need to protect the
information. Working along with the technologies can help in ensuring better protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rapid Evolution of Technologies
In the fast-paced world of today, technology is evolving like never before. The emergence of
the latest technologies, such as cloud technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and more
cybersecurity threats. So, instead of investing more in defense assets, it is vital to be more
conscious and aware of your surroundings. Being vigilant can help detect the anomalies and
report them as soon as possible, thereby preventing cyber attacks.
All the pointers mentioned above make it clear that information security is everyone’s
responsibility. In the era of growing cyber attacks, everyone starting from the customer
support executives to the CEO of the organization can weaken or strengthen the
organizations' IT systems.</p>
